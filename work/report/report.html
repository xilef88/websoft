<h2>S03</h2>
<p>Here is the text for this section.</p>
<p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?
</p>
<p>
I dont have any previous experience of client side JavaScript, just the experince from lectures.
</p>
<p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?
</p>
<p>
Yes, i have worked alot in Java and JavaScript resembles it, you can even use the some of the same syntax.
 </p>
 <p>
   Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language, and JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language.

   Java code must be compiled, and JavaScript code is all-text.
 </p>
<p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
</p>
 <p>
For the Exercise i worked from the descibtion and googled what i didnt know or wasnt sure about. I also talked to classmates about solutions.
I think we lacked alot of explanation on the schoool part, I think this part wa very confusing. I aim for grade 5 but still have to work on the school part for that but the rest i have done and it was fun.

<p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language? </p>
<p>It was intresting to learn about and combining it with database and working on the server side. </p>

<p>JavaScipt and mysql is scipt languages so can compare that. Syntax looks like C code.   </p>

<p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
<p>First i just followed your instrutions and looked again on the videos you posted.  </p>
<p>In the assignment most was just to change the style to php so not so hard in the beginning. Then we played around with database and also fixed a search page, i was happy with grade 3 because struggles with the thesis in the other course. </p>
