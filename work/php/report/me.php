    <p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

    <p>My name is Felix Karlsson, born in Ã–nnestad and raised in Torsebro and Helgedal, both just outside of Kristianstad. I liked to play computer games and being outside to play soccer, I played all diffrent computer-games and that made me
      intrested in computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nowadays i dont play any computer-games unless its a social thing with friends. Soccer has been something constant in my life and have not had a break from it since i was a kid. I've been working alot of diffrent jobs, first job was selling
      strawberries, ive been a lifeguard, disher/kitchen-hand, secretary, archive assistant.
    </p>

      Ive also been a little of a globetrotter and traveled after my gymnasieum, i moved to Australia for two years, where i was traveling and stopping to work when i ran out of money. I also went to south east asia for half year, traveling thorugh
      many countries and experiencing many cultures.</p>

    When i came back from my travels i applied for Datasystemsutvecklingsprogrammet at Kristianstad University. </p>
